# DSA Study Repository

This repository contains my personal study materials and practice problems for Data Structures and Algorithms.

## 📚 Focus Areas
- **Data Structures**: Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, Hash Tables
- **Algorithms**: Sorting, Searching, Recursion, Dynamic Programming, Greedy Algorithms
- **Problem Solving**: LeetCode, HackerRank, CodeForces problems
- **Complexity Analysis**: Time and Space Complexity (Big O notation)
- **Pattern Recognition**: Common problem-solving patterns and techniques

## 🎯 Purpose
This is my personal practice space where I:
- Solve coding challenges regularly
- Implement data structures from scratch
- Practice algorithm design and optimization
- Prepare for technical interviews
- Track my progress in DSA mastery
